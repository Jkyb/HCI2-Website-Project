            <h2>C: Choose the evaluation approach and methods</h2>
            <p>
                For the evaluation approach and methods, a combination of usability testing and heuristic evaluation were employed. Usability testing involves directly observing administrators as they interact with the system to complete various tasks, such as logging in as an administrator, exploring dashboard, managing category list, etc. Heuristic evaluation is conducted by usability experts who assess the interface using established principles like Nielsen’s heuristics.
            </p>

        <section>
            <h2>I: Identify the practical issues</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Availability of real users (administrators) for testing.</li>
                <li>System is running on localhost, resulting in external users not being able to access it unless deployed online.</li>
                <li>Testers must be familiar with mobile inventory systems to give relevant feedback.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>D: Decide how to deal with ethical issues</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>All usability participants must provide informed consent before taking part in any session.</li>
                <li>No sensitive or personally identifiable information will be recorded without explicit permission.</li>
                <li>All feedback gathered during testing will be treated anonymously and used solely for system improvement purposes.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>E: Evaluate, interpret, and present the data</h2>
            <p>
                Data gathered through usability testing and heuristic evaluation will be carefully analyzed to assess the system’s effectiveness. For usability testing, task success rates, error frequencies, and time-on-task will be compiled to measure the system's efficiency and usability. Heuristic evaluation will be used to identify violations of usability principles, such as issues with consistency, feedback, or error prevention.
